            About Me!
        </h1>
            <p>
                My name is Sean Landers. I am originally from Virginia.  
                I was an Interrogator in the Army for 8 years. I am a pretty avid video game player (mostly World of Warcraft and 
                league of legends once upon a time.) I have a degree in middle east studies and am fluent in Arabic. My current
                goal is to be a C# developer and get a job working on the JEDI project for Microsoft.
